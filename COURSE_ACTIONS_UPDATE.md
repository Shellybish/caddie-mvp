# Course Actions Component Update

## Overview
Updated the course actions component to change from "Watch", "Like", "Watchlist" to "Played", "Like", "Bucket List" with full functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Updates
- **New table**: `review_likes` - tracks which users have liked which reviews
- **Updated table**: `course_reviews` - now allows 0 ratings to track "played" status without rating
- **New constraints**: Modified unique constraints to allow multiple "played" entries but only one rated review per user per course per date
- **New functions**: Added PostgreSQL functions for checking likes, play status, and counts

### 2. API Updates
- **Added**: `likeReview()` function in `src/lib/api/courses.ts`
- **Added**: `hasUserLikedReview()` function for checking like status
- **Added**: `getReviewLikesCount()` function for getting like counts
- **Added**: `hasUserPlayedCourse()` function for checking if user has played a course
- **Added**: `markCourseAsPlayed()` function for marking courses as played without rating
- **Added**: New API routes:
  - `/api/courses/[id]/played` - POST to mark course as played
  - `/api/courses/[id]/bucket-list` - GET/POST/DELETE for bucket list management

### 3. Component Updates
- **Updated**: `src/components/courses/course-actions.tsx`
  - Changed icons and labels from "Watch", "Like", "Watchlist" to "Played", "Like", "Bucket List"
  - Added state management for played status and bucket list status
  - Added functionality for each action:
    - **Played**: Marks course as played (shows checkmark if already played)
    - **Like**: Placeholder for future review liking functionality
    - **Bucket List**: Adds/removes course from user's bucket list
  - Added visual feedback (colors, filled icons) for active states
  - Added loading states and error handling

### 4. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Next.js warning about `searchParams` not being awaited in course detail page
- **Fixed**: Missing `likeReview` export that was causing import errors

## Database Migration Required

Run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- See database-updates.sql file for complete script
```

## Key Features

### "Played" Functionality
- Users can mark courses as "played" without rating them
- Creates a `course_reviews` entry with `rating = 0`
- Visual indicator shows green checkmark when course has been played
- When user rates a course, it automatically marks as "played"

### "Bucket List" Functionality  
- Uses existing `bucket_list_courses` table
- Users can add/remove courses from their bucket list
- Visual indicator shows blue bookmark when course is in bucket list

### "Like" Functionality (Future)
- Infrastructure is in place for liking reviews
- Database table and API functions created
- Currently shows placeholder button (to be implemented)

## Visual States

### Played Button
- **Default**: Gray "Mark Played" with outline check icon
- **Active**: Green "Played" with filled check icon

### Bucket List Button  
- **Default**: Gray "Bucket List" with outline bookmark icon
- **Active**: Blue "In Bucket List" with filled bookmark icon

### Like Button (Future)
- Currently shows gray heart icon (placeholder)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Apply Database Updates**:
   - Copy content from `database-updates.sql`
   - Run in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Test Played Functionality**:
   - Visit any course page
   - Click "Mark Played" button
   - Should show success toast and button turns green
   - Rating a course should also mark as played

3. **Test Bucket List Functionality**:
   - Click "Bucket List" button
   - Should show success toast and button turns blue with filled icon
   - Click again to remove from bucket list

4. **Test Rating Functionality**:
   - Click any star to rate the course
   - Should submit rating AND mark course as played
   - Both actions should be reflected in the UI

## Error Handling

- All actions require user authentication
- Proper error messages shown for failures
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Database constraints prevent duplicate entries

## Future Enhancements

1. **Like Reviews**: Complete the review liking functionality
2. **Course Statistics**: Show how many users have played each course
3. **Activity Feed**: Show recent plays in user activity
4. **Course Recommendations**: Use play history for recommendations
